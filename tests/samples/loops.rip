# not sure how useful a for loop would be, but here is what it would look like
#for (x in [ 1, 2, 3 ]) {
#  # do stuff
#}

# or like this
#for ([ 1, 2, 3 ]: x) {
#  # do stuff
#}

# loop runs forever
while (true) {
  # do stuff
}

# loop never runs
until (true) {
  # do stuff

  if (condition) {
    next  # skip to next iteration
  } else {
    break # break out of loop
  }
}

# post-fix example
# loop runs once, then exits
{
  # do stuff
} until (true)
